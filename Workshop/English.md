[h1]Simple Improve[/h1]

Transform your colony's infrastructure over time! Simple Improve lets you upgrade the quality of furniture and other buildings with quality through skilled construction work.

[h2]CORE FEATURES[/h2]
[list]
[*] Mark any furniture or building with quality for improvement
[*] Pawns use construction skill to enhance buildings from Awful to Masterwork quality
[*] Smart multi-building selection with consolidated controls
[*] Configurable skill requirements with 5 quality standards presets
[/list]

[h2]FUNCTIONALITY[/h2]
[list]
[*] Makes use of Rimworld's built-in quality system
[*] The chances of success are exactly the same as if you were constructing the building fresh
[*] All improvements are kept, even if they don't meet the target quality
[/list]

[h2]QUALITY STANDARDS PRESETS[/h2]
[list]
[*] Apprentice: Loose skill requirements (high failure rates, but any assigned pawn can make attempts)
[*] Novice: Low skill requirements (moderate success rates, and most pawns can make attempts)
[*] Default: Balanced requirements (reasonable success rates for all tiers)
[*] Master: High skill requirements (higher success rate, only well prepared pawns can make attempts)
[*] Artisan: Tight skill requirements (minimal waste, only pawns with a high likelihood of success can make attempts)
[*] Custom: Set your own skill thresholds (full control over skill requirements for each quality tier)
[/list]

[h2]FLEXIBLE GAMEPLAY[/h2]
[list]
[*] Traditional mode: Requires materials like normal construction (default)
[*] Labor-only mode: Improvements cost only time and skill
[*] Works with any modded furniture or building that has quality
[*] New "Improving" work type with separate priority from construction (for pawns that are working on improving items)
[/list]

[h3][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3540117812]Biosculpter Detox[/url][/h3]
Adds a detox cycle mechanic to biosculpter pods that cures addictions and tolerances in a safe and expedient manner.

[h3][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3549864494]Chrono Save[/url][/h3]
Adds functionality to autosave based on real world time rather than in-game time. If you spend 20 minutes planning your base while paused, it will create Chronosaves during. Won't interfere with vanilla autosaves.
