This directory should contain a 64x64 PNG file named "Improve.png" for the improvement designator icon.

For now, the mod uses the built-in "Haul" designator texture as a placeholder.

To create a proper icon:
1. Create a 64x64 pixel PNG image 
2. Design an icon that represents "improvement" or "upgrade" 
3. Save it as "Improve.png" in this directory
4. Update the DesignationDef to use "UI/Designators/Improve" as the texturePath
