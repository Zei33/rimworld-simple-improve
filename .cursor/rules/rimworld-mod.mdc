# Simple Improve Mod Info

This is a Rimworld mod aimed at version 1.6

## Environment

Rimworld is a multi-platform game built on Unity version 2022.3 LTS.

The mod is written in C# and uses dotnet version 4.7.2 and MonoBleedingEdge version 6.12.x 

Harmony version 2.3.6 is used for compatibility with other mods.

## Mod Summary

The mod provides a new action on buildings that have a quality level, like beds, tables, chairs, etc.

These buildings can be marked by the player to be improved.

When a pawn is assigned to improvement (a construction task), they must meet a certain construction skill level. If they meet the level, they can attempt to improve the quality of the marked building.

Improvement requires the same resources as the building would initially require to be built.

When the improvement task is completed, the building quality is re-rolled based on the pawn's construction skill level. 

If the new quality level is the same or worse, it is not applied. An "Improvement failed!" message will be displayed over the building. The resources will be consumed and the task will be retried if there are enough resources left over to do so.

If the new quality level is better, then it will be applied to the building. The resources will be consumed and the task will be completed. A message with "Improved to [quality]!" will be displayed over the building.
