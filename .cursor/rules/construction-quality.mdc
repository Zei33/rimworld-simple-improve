# Construction Quality

Below is the vanilla (un-modded) quality table that RimWorld uses when a pawn **finishes** a piece of furniture.
The same distribution is used for all items that rely on the **Construction** skill; the only thing that changes is the builder’s skill level.

| Construction skill | Awful  | Poor   | Normal | Good   | Excellent | Masterwork | **≥ Good** | **≥ Excellent** |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 0                  | 64.6 % | 30.2 % | 5.0 %  | 0.2 %  | 0 %       | 0 %        | 0.2 %      | 0 %             |
| 4                  | 4.8 %  | 45.2 % | 39.4 % | 10.0 % | 0.6 %     | 0.01 %     | 10.6 %     | 0.61 %          |
| 6                  | 1.0 %  | 24.2 % | 52.1 % | 20.4 % | 2.2 %     | 0.03 %     | 22.6 %     | 2.24 %          |
| 8                  | 0.13 % | 9.0 %  | 50.8 % | 33.5 % | 6.4 %     | 0.15 %     | 40.1 %     | 6.58 %          |
| 10                 | 0.02 % | 3.3 %  | 40.2 % | 43.8 % | 12.2 %    | 0.45 %     | 56.5 %     | 12.7 %          |
| 12                 | —      | 1.0 %  | 24.6 % | 52.7 % | 20.6 %    | 1.19 %     | 74.4 %     | 21.8 %          |
| 14                 | —      | 0.4 %  | 15.8 % | 54.3 % | 27.4 %    | 2.15 %     | 83.8 %     | 29.5 %          |
| 16                 | —      | 0.14 % | 9.3 %  | 52.4 % | 34.5 %    | 3.67 %     | 90.6 %     | 38.2 %          |
| 18                 | —      | 0.04 % | 5.0 %  | 47.7 % | 41.2 %    | 6.06 %     | 95.0 %     | 47.3 %          |
| 20                 | —      | 0.01 % | 2.4 %  | 37.4 % | 50.6 %    | 9.58 %     | 97.5 %     | 60.1 %          |

### Level needed for each quality

* **Normal or better 50 % chance** – Construction 4
* **Normal on average (mean = Normal)** – Construction 6
* **Good or better ≥ 50 %** – Construction 10
* **Excellent or better ≥ 20 %** – Construction 12
* **Masterwork appears at all from level 4 upward, but remains < 10 % even at level 20**
* **Legendary** – impossible in vanilla without a quality boost:

  * *Inspired Creativity* raises the final roll two tiers (e.g. Excellent→Legendary)
  * *Production Specialist* (Ideology DLC) raises it one tier and can stack with inspirations

### How RimWorld calculates those percentages

1. **When work finishes**, the game calls `QualityUtility.GenerateQuality`.
2. It pulls a number from a **Gaussian (normal) distribution** whose **mean shifts upward with skill**.

   * Roughly speaking, every skill point nudges the mean quality ~0.18 tiers higher; the standard deviation is constant, so low skill yields a wide spread toward low-quality outcomes while high skill clusters rolls in the high-quality band.
3. The sampled value is **rounded and clamped** into the six quality categories:

   * 0 = Awful, 1 = Poor, 2 = Normal, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent, 5 = Masterwork.
4. External modifiers (Inspired Creativity, Production Specialist, some mods) **shift the result up** after the roll, enabling Legendary (tier 6).

Because the system is probabilistic you can’t *guarantee* a specific tier, but the thresholds above tell you **when the odds tilt strongly in your favour**.
