  <description>Transform your colony's infrastructure over time! Simple Improve lets you upgrade the quality of furniture and other buildings with quality through skilled construction work.

CORE FEATURES:
• Mark any furniture or building with quality for improvement
• Pawns use construction skill to enhance buildings from Awful to Masterwork quality
• Smart multi-building selection with consolidated controls
• Configurable skill requirements with 5 quality standards presets

FUNCTIONALITY:
• Makes use of Rimworld's built-in quality system
• The chances of success are exactly the same as if you were constructing the building fresh
• All improvements are kept, even if they don't meet the target quality

QUALITY STANDARDS PRESETS:
• Apprentice: Loose skill requirements (high failure rates, but any assigned pawn can make attempts)
• Novice: Low skill requirements (moderate success rates, and most pawns can make attempts)
• Default: Balanced requirements (reasonable success rates for all tiers)
• Master: High skill requirements (higher success rate, only well prepared pawns can make attempts)
• Artisan: Tight skill requirements (minimal waste, only pawns with a high likelihood of success can make attempts)
• Custom: Set your own skill thresholds (full control over skill requirements for each quality tier)

FLEXIBLE GAMEPLAY:
• Traditional mode: Requires materials like normal construction (default)
• Adjustable material costs: Set improvement costs from 5% of original build cost upwards
• Labor-only mode: Improvements cost only time and skill
• Works with any modded furniture or building that has quality
• New "Improving" work type with separate priority from construction (for pawns that are working on improving items)

ENHANCED INTERFACE:
• Drag-select multiple items for batch improvement
• Helpful settings menu</description>
