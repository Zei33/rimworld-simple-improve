## Overview

Simple Improve adds a new construction system to RimWorld that lets you upgrade the quality of furniture and other constructed items. Instead of being stuck with normal-quality furniture forever, you can now invest materials and skilled labor to improve them over time.

## Features

### üîß Quality Improvement System
- **Mark any furniture or constructed item** with quality for improvement
- **Skill-based outcomes** - Higher construction skill increases success chances
- **Flexible material requirements** - Option to require materials like normal construction, or just time and labor
- **Smart failure handling** - Failed improvements consume materials (if required) but preserve the item

### üéØ Flexible Skill Requirements
- **Configurable thresholds** for each quality tier
- **Default settings** based on 5% success chance:
  - Normal: Construction 4
  - Good: Construction 10  
  - Excellent: Construction 14
  - Masterwork: Construction 18
- **Pawn modifiers** supported:
  - **Inspired Creativity** (+2 quality tiers)
  - **Production Specialist** (+1 quality tier)
  - Modifiers can stack to enable Legendary quality

### üé® Intuitive User Interface
- **Drag-select designators** for marking multiple items at once
- **Smart multi-building selection** with consolidated controls - no more duplicate buttons!
- **Intelligent quality targeting** with context-aware options based on your selection
- **Cross-group operations** - set quality targets for all selected buildings at once
- **Individual item toggles** via building gizmos
- **Visual feedback** with success/failure messages
- **Enhanced settings menu** with preset system, tooltips, and improved organization
- **Quality distribution calculator** for testing different configurations

### ‚öôÔ∏è Seamless Integration  
- **New "Improving" work type** with separate priority from construction
- **Automatic material hauling** - Pawns gather resources automatically
- **Experience gain** - Construction skill improves while working
- **Universal mod compatibility** - Works with any mod that adds quality to buildings
- **Optimized performance** - Intelligent caching prevents UI slowdowns

## Installation

### Steam Workshop
1. Subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop
2. Ensure **Harmony** is installed (required dependency)
3. Enable the mod in your mod list
4. Start or reload your save

### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page]
2. Extract to your RimWorld `Mods` folder
3. Install [Harmony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077) if not already installed
4. Enable both mods in your mod list

## Usage

### Marking Items for Improvement

1. **Using Designators**:
   - Open the Architect menu ‚Üí Improve tab
   - Select "Mark for Improvement" 
   - Click on items or drag to select multiple
   - Use "Cancel Improvement" to remove designations

2. **Using Item Buttons**:
   - Select any improvable item (or multiple items)
   - Click the improvement toggle button in the item's gizmo bar
   - When multiple buildings are selected, the mod shows consolidated buttons grouped by improvement state
   - Choose quality targets from the dropdown menu - options adapt based on your selection

### How Improvement Works

1. **Designation**: Mark items for improvement using the designator or item button
2. **Material Hauling**: Pawns with "Improving" work enabled will gather required materials
3. **Construction Work**: Pawns perform improvement work based on their construction skill
4. **Quality Roll**: New quality is determined using RimWorld's standard quality system
5. **Result**: If quality improves, the new quality is applied; otherwise materials are consumed and the process can retry

### Understanding Success Rates

Quality improvement uses RimWorld's standard construction quality system. Higher construction skill dramatically improves your chances:

| Construction Skill | Good+ Chance | Excellent+ Chance | Masterwork+ Chance |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 8                 | 40.1%        | 6.6%              | 0.15%             |
| 10                | 56.5%        | 12.7%             | 0.45%             |
| 12                | 74.4%        | 21.8%             | 1.19%             |
| 16                | 90.6%        | 38.2%             | 3.67%             |
| 20                | 97.5%        | 60.1%             | 9.58%             |

Compatible with mods that increase skills above 20.

## Configuration

### Mod Settings

Access the mod settings through:
**Options ‚Üí Mod Settings ‚Üí Simple Improve**

#### Quality Standards Presets

Choose from pre-configured pawn skill requirements for different improvement strategies:

- **üå± Apprentice**: Very low skill requirements - allows any pawn to attempt improvements (high failure rates)
- **üìö Novice**: Low skill requirements - most pawns can attempt improvements with moderate success  
- **‚öñÔ∏è Default**: Balanced skill requirements - ensures reasonable success chances for most attempts
- **üéØ Master**: High skill requirements - only skilled pawns can attempt improvements (high success rates)
- **üèÜ Artisan**: Very high skill requirements - only master craftsmen can attempt improvements (very high success rates)
- **üõ†Ô∏è Custom**: Set your own minimum skill requirements for each quality tier

#### Advanced Settings

- **Require Materials for Improvement**: Toggle whether improvements need materials like normal construction, or just require work time
- **Skill Requirements**: Adjust minimum construction skill needed for each quality tier (Custom preset only)
- **Quality Calculator**: Test different success rates and skill requirements
- **Success Thresholds**: Set desired success percentages to automatically calculate skill requirements

### Recommended Settings

**For balanced gameplay**: Use the **Default** preset, which provides balanced skill requirements ensuring reasonable success chances for most improvement attempts.

**For fast improvements**: Try **Apprentice** or **Novice** presets to allow lower-skilled pawns to attempt improvements, accepting higher failure rates for faster progression.

**For efficient material usage**: Use **Master** or **Artisan** presets to ensure only highly-skilled pawns attempt improvements, minimizing wasted materials from failed attempts.

**Material-free mode**: Disable "Require Materials for Improvement" in Advanced Settings if you prefer improvements to only cost time and labor, eliminating material waste from failures.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The mod uses clean, modular architecture with minimal Harmony patches for maximum compatibility:

- **Component System**: Uses RimWorld's ThingComp system for item state management
- **Job System**: Integrates with RimWorld's work system for natural pawn behavior  
- **Material Storage**: Custom storage system restricts hauling to required materials only
- **Settings Framework**: Persistent configuration with runtime updates

### Compatibility

- **Harmony Requirement**: Uses Harmony 2.3.6 for compatibility patches
- **Mod Support**: Automatically works with modded items that have quality
- **Save Compatibility**: Safe to add to existing saves; removes cleanly when disabled

### Performance

- **Efficient Caching**: Caches calculations and lookups where possible
- **Minimal Patches**: Only patches designation removal for clean integration
- **Standard Systems**: Uses RimWorld's built-in systems for work, hauling, and quality

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I improve items to Legendary quality?**
A: Only with pawn modifiers like Inspired Creativity or Production Specialist roles. The base system caps at Masterwork.

**Q: What happens if improvement fails?**
A: Materials are consumed but the item keeps its original quality. If materials remain, the improvement can be retried.

**Q: Does this work with modded furniture?**
A: Yes! Any item with a quality stat and proper blueprint definition will work automatically.

**Q: Can I control which pawns can attempt improvements?**
A: Yes! Choose from 5 preset skill requirement levels (Apprentice to Artisan) or use Custom mode. Apprentice allows any pawn to try (with high failure rates), while Artisan requires master-level construction skill (ensuring high success rates).

**Q: Do I always need materials for improvements?**
A: No! In the mod settings under Advanced Settings, you can disable "Require Materials for Improvement" to make improvements only require time and labor instead of resources.
